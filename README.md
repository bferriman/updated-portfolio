# updated-portfolio

## Description

In this project, I have rebuilt my portfolio site from the ground up to highlight recently completed projects and evolve the design.

The site was developed to serve as my presence on the web, particularly for prospective employers.  It contains a bio, contact information, links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and my resume, and some of my projects.

## Opportunities For Further Development

Needs a professional headshot.

The styling of the page needs a lot more work. What is currently in place is just a quick first pass. There are a lot of details that need polished up (white bars around the headshot at some screen resolutions for example).

Could use a more developed color palette.

I would like to add some animation to make the site come alive a little bit.

Responsiveness and layout at mobile resolutions is less than ideal.
